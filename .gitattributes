# Generically .gitattributes gives attributes to pathnames
# See more details in the official Git documentation https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes
# GitHub also has a page on line endings including how to refresh your local repo after changing adding .gitattributes
# https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings#refreshing-a-repository-after-changing-line-endings

# The main purpose of this .gitattributes file is to prevent eol inconsistencies due to local Git mis-configuration
# For example a Windows user, may not choose the default of core.autocrlf = true when installing Git
# or they may change this setting and unwittingly edit and commit .sh files with Windows line endings (CRLF)
# These .gitattributes settings take precedence over the user's git config

# The following peforms LF normalization on files detected as text, otherwise binary files committed with CRLF are left alone
*          text=auto
# The more specific settings below override the above setting

# Note that setting text=auto is different to setting text
# Setting text, always treats the file as text and always does LF normalisation

# You can find all file types in your own repo by running the following PowerShell, and add any not already listed
# Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File | Select-Object Extension | Sort-Object Extension -Unique=
# You can do the same for files with no extension with this PowerShell
# Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File | Where-Object -Not Extension

# With additions (eg Terraform), others from https://github.com/alexkaratarakis/gitattributes/blob/master/Common.gitattributes

# These files often have no extension
